# Detecting AI-Generated Text

This repository focuses on two distinct approaches for the detection of AI-generated text. The used dataset are: 
1) https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/llm-detect-ai-generated-text/data
2) https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedrcat/daigt-v2-train-dataset

## Approaches

### a) Ensemble Method
   - The ensemble method leverages a combination of multiple models to enhance the accuracy of text detection. 

### b) Pre-trained BERT Model
   - In this approach, we employ a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for text classification, in combination with additional dense layers/
